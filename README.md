# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## How Acceptance Criteria was Met

**Semantic HTML Elements** - Rewrote non-semantic elements in order to be semantic, such as replacing <div> or <span> with <aside>. Also removed unnecessary instances of classes, such as replacing div class="footer" with <footer>.

**HTML Elements follow logical structure** - Rearranged HTML elements to follow a logical structure and formatted properly to increase clarity.

**All images have Alt attrributes** - Ensured that all images are assigned alt tags for the purposes of search engine optimization.

**Heading attributes fall in sequential order** - Replaced instance of <h2> in the footer with <h4> to ensure all heading attributes are sequential. 

**Title has concise, descriptive title** - Replaced the generic placeholder title with Horiseon.
