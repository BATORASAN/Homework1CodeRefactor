# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## How Acceptance Criteria was Met

**Semantic HTML Elements** - Rewrote non-semantic elements in order to be semantic, such as replacing &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt; with &lt;aside&gt;. Also removed unnecessary instances of classes, such as replacing div class="footer" with &lt;footer&gt;.

**HTML Elements follow logical structure** - Rearranged HTML elements to follow a logical structure and formatted properly to increase clarity.

**All images have Alt attrributes** - Ensured that all images are assigned alt tags for the purposes of search engine optimization.

**Heading attributes fall in sequential order** - Replaced instance of &lt;h2&gt; in the footer with &lt;h4&gt; to ensure all heading attributes are sequential. 

**Title has concise, descriptive title** - Replaced the generic placeholder title with Horiseon.
